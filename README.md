# Expression Interpreter and Compiler in Go

### Purpose

I write this project while learning to use the helix (basically, VIM editor with lsp support) to remember VIM controls and keyboard shortcuts. I'm forcing myself to use VIM because in my work I often use VIM or VI on VM servers and I want to feel comfortable.

### How you can use it

- education
  I tried to document and explain the entire algorithm in code. If you want to know, how compilers work (at basic level) - feel free to read source code. (notice: i am not an english speaking person)

- simple interpreter
