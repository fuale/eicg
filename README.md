# Expression Interpreter and Compiler in Go

### Purpose

I write this project while learning to use the helix (basically, VIM editor with lsp support) to remember VIM controls and keyboard shortcuts. I'm forcing myself to use VIM because in my work I often use VIM or VI on VM servers and I want to feel comfortable.
